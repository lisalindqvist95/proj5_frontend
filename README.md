## Design

### Colour Pallete

The colour pallete on the site was chosen based on early 2000´s makeup computer games which the target group might recognize to give the site a playful feeling. The colors have been muted a bit in order to make the site feel more mature. 

### Wireframes
The first wireframes were rough sketches made by hand on paper for the layout.

### Bugs

Log out function does not work
At first there was a bug which made it possible to log in but not out. This was fixed by rewriting some of the code for that function so the bug was probobly due to a spelling mistake. 

Pin does not work
The pinning function did not work and resulted in a Error 500 message. This was resolved when the model was rewritten in the API, the issue was most likely due to a spelling mistake. 


### Unfixed bugs

### React JS Components

This project is built using React JS components which breaks up the code inte different elements that can be used across the site in a variety of applications so that the same code does not have to be duplicated several times. It also helps with developing since you can updtae individual components indepentendly. The re-use of components across the site also offers a better user experience since it provides a consistency. 

This project reuses the user avatar, navbar menu, dropdown menu and "not found" message across all parts of the site.
